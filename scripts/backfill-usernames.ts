/**
 * One-off data migration: assigns a `username` to every existing user row that doesn't
 * have one yet (the column is nullable specifically for this — see
 * src/db/schema/auth.ts). Safe to re-run: rows that already have a username are left
 * untouched, and freshly-generated ones are checked against every username already in
 * use (including ones this same run just assigned) before being written.
 *
 * New signups never need this — src/lib/auth.ts assigns a username automatically at
 * account creation. This script only exists for accounts created before that shipped.
 *
 *   pnpm backfill:usernames
 *
 * Run this once per database, any time after the `username` column migration
 * (drizzle/0004_*.sql or later — check `pnpm db:generate`'s output) has been applied
 * with `pnpm db:migrate`. Uses the same `--conditions=react-server` invocation as
 * `pnpm seed:demo` (see scripts/seed-demo.ts) for consistency, though this script's own
 * imports don't currently need it.
